                            <p>It’s just a moment in time – just one hand reaching over the counter to present a cup to another outstretched hand.
                               <br>But it’s a connection....
                               <br>We make sure everything we do honors that connection – from our commitment to the highest quality coffee in the world, to the way we engage with our customers and communities to do business responsibly.
                               <br>From our beginnings as a single store over forty years ago, in every place that we’ve been, and every place that we touch, we've tried to make it a little better than we found it.
